- 4.0.0 - Dependency update, output settings, bug fix
   - **BREAKING CHANGE** Updated dependencies mean that minimum Node.js version is now v10 (previously v8). Minimum Node-RED version is now v1.0 (prevously v0.13)
   - Update dependencies
   - Move change log to separate file from readme.
   - Contributed changes, see [Issue #34](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/node-red-contrib-moment/issues/34):
     - Explanation extended, examples added
     - Testing flows moved from subdir examples\ to subdir testing\
     - .html help extended  
   - Prep for Node-RED v1.
   - Workaround for upstream parseFormat bug, see [Issue #24](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/node-red-contrib-moment/issues/24). If input is an ISO date string with seconds >3dp, the input is trimmed to 3dp seconds.
   - Added `msg.settings` to output msg. Shows the settings/parameters used. Allows for further processing or validation if needed.
   - Added ability to override input and output Timezone settings from an incoming msg object. The appropriate setting must be empty and the properties to use are `msg.inTz` and `msg.outTz`. Resolves [Issue #31](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/node-red-contrib-moment/issues/31).
